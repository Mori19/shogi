A project to make a text based shogi game

I am working on a project to try and make a simple text based shogi game. I intent to start with minishogi, but I want to make it an option to select what board size to play on (there are multiple shogi versions). I am working to make this a discord bot at the moment, as this is the easiest way to deploy it. 


NOTE: at the beginning of the main script, there is an import for shogibot_token. This is just a file with my personal bot token in format 
TOKEN = "token value found on discord"
The bot will not work without your own token.
