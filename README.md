A project to make a text based shogi game

I am working on a project to try and make a simple text based shogi game. I intent to start with minishogi, but I want to make it an option to select what board size to play on (there are multiple shogi versions). I am working to make this a discord bot at the moment, as this is the easiest way to deploy it.
